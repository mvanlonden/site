## Problem

As Pinterest, Houzz, Etsy, Dwell and other home-based publications and applications provide homeowners with inspiration, interior designers struggle with managing client preference while aligning decisions with their expertise. A new house or large renovation can contain hundreds of selections and keeping track of options and selections made can be a cumbersome process.

## Solution

In comes Design Docket, a web application to manage selections. Complete with projects, categorical tagging, access-level controls and real-time collaboration. Create a board for each room or a board for each type of hardware. Designers present potential options for each selection and the client can select one of the options or suggest an alternative. Once the selection are made the contractor is added to the board and uses it as a reference to know what to purchase.
