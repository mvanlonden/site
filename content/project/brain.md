> Unlocking the brain

Perfecting brain-computer interfaces would allow data to flow freely between human and machine. My fascination with brain began when studying Neurophysiology at UMD and continues to today.

## Open Brain 
This is an open source project for OpenBCI, a brain computer interface chip maker. Open Brain extends the capabilities of OpenBCI or other EEG devices.

It takes a serial stream from the hardware and converts it to socket, UDP, or OSC stream. It also provides a visual interface to monitor the hardware. 

### Technologies used
- Angular
- Python
- UDP
- Material Design
