## Problem

Developers typically use Github to share and save code. Github is a powerful tool when maintaining repositories of code, but it isn't well suited for real-time collaboration. Real-time collaboration can be especially helpful in an educational setting.

## Solution
Devshare provides a shared development environment where users can work together on a project in real-time. Each project can consist of multiple files and folders. See which file or folder your collaborator is in and edit the document together!
