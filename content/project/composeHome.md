## Inspiration

My partner, Tiffany, and I are looking to buy our first house. After renting in New York and the Bay Area for over five years we're ready to buy our own place. Unfortunately, the price for a starter home in heavily populated and desirable metropolitan areas is just too high to justify the cost for us.

For many years we've talked with our friends about starting a community built for us, by us. We've all read stories like [bestie row](http://lightersideofrealestate.com/around-the-home/architecture/tiny-house-bestie-row) and how great would that be? Quickly we realized that building a house let alone a community is a fairly involved process. 

This vision in conjunction with the prefab house movement makes for some really evocative concepts.

## Process

Our venture has taken many forms, from a platform where developers can bid on virtual communities to a marketplace where real estate agents can list buildable land. As we've morphed through these various prototypes we've continued to build our marketplace of prefab homes to help us and others compare prefab home offerings. This marketplace features a fully functional CMS so the prefab companies can manage their own content.

Most recently, we're looking to do the development ourselves. After immersing ourselves in this world for a year we've modeled out the construction cash flows, refined our marketing approach, and understand the various components involved in buying land, developing the land and building a prefab home. Our first community will be built for geographically flexible individuals in a more rural area with quick access to a decent airport, beautiful natural surroundings and high speed internet.
