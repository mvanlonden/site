> Collaborative knowledge management for researchers

## Problem
Researchers ingest and manage a lot of information. Copy and pasting text is easy but sources are lost if not explicitly stored. Slack has created a great platform for building collaborative processes around a chat thread, but information gets forgotten in old threads. Github is a great platform for repositories of code with code versioning and collaborative merging, but this only benefits developers. 

## Solution
Borealis brings research teams together by creating centralized knowledge repositories. A body of knowledge is not lost when a team member leaves and a new team member can quickly get up to speed in a specific domain. Borealis serves as a way to visually organize and manipulate information while preserving the source. A chrome extension enables the end user to highlight web content creating information modules. PDFs can be uploaded and highlighted to create modules. Furthermore, images can be uploaded and plain text modules can be created in app. Borealis was built with extensibility in mind to allow for an ecosystem of integrations to enhance workflows and information management.

## Process
I led a team of three web developers to make Borealis a reality. We built it over the course of three months.
