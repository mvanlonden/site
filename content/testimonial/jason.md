quote: We hired Mel to perform a 'surge' of development, moving one of our mission-critical tools from Angular to React/Redux. He estimated and executed the task quickly, effectively, and with excellent, frequent, and consistent communication. He also advised on better architectural options and techniques for us to consider for future development. He worked very well with our staff, responding to code-review and prioritization quickly and professionally.
